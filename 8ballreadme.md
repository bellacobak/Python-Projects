# Magic 8-Ball Game
In this project I created a Magic 8-Ball game using Python. I used basic Python functionalities to create a user driven game.
The game starts with the user being prompted to enter their name and to ask a yes or no question. Then a random number generator is used to determine what the Magic 8 Ball's response will be. The Magic 8 Ball has nine different responses, so each response coordinates with a number from 1 to 9. Then the user's question is displayed followed by the Magic 8 Ball's response to the user's question. 
The user is then asked if they wish to ask another question, if yes the game continues, otherwise no then the game ends.
